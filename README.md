Next Steps / Broad Framework: 

1. Find and collect data
	- find datasets, apis, historical/live data etc

Data Types:
- 1.i) Historic Betting odds and results, opening & closing
- 1.ii) Data Golf - historic player performance
- 1.iii) Real time - injury status, player momentum / flailing
- 1.iv) Course data - weather, location, travel time, etc.
- 1.v) Anything else

2. Clean and Preprocess Data
	- Handle missing values
	- standardize data
	- possible feauture engineering

3. Model Development
	- Define a goal/what we want to predict using our data (eg. final round wins, live in game betting, over/unders etc)
	- Make sure to use appropriate model for each of problem
	- Maybe look into other alternative data we can use to improve model as much as possible

4. Backtest and optimize
	- traning/ test split 
	- possibly simulate historical bets
	- Performance Report

5. Real time
- JS will give 50-100$ for you to fuck around with and try to win, feel free to contribute if succesful

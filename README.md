Next Steps / Broad Framework: 

1. Find and collect data
	- find datasets, apis, historical/live data etc

2. Clean and Preprocess Data
	- Handle missing values
	- standardize data
	- possible feauture engineering

3. Model Development
	- Define a goal/what we want to predict using our data (eg. final round wins, live in game betting, over/unders etc)
	- Make sure to use appropriate model for each of problem
	- Maybe look into other alternative data we can use to improve model as much as possible

4. Backtest and optimize
	- traning/test test
	- possibly simulate historical bets
	- Performance Report

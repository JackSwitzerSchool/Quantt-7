I need your help!

I have yet to solve a Jane Street Puzzle despite a couple of attempts, and I don't have time to finish a solution this month.

I want you guys to try and solve the problem. Currently here is the code I have:

1) A Python script that models the board and attempts to brute force solve this on a CPU.

2) A CUDA C++ implementation that attempts to solve the problem on a GPU. This does not really work but it's a workable direction, there are other ways to get compute tho...

3) The data board.csv that should be placed in an internal /data/input folder.

4) Some random configs like CMakeLists.txt, and a .gitignore

Although brute force does not work, is there another easier way to solve this? There's often an easy trick. Check out the puzzles at: https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/

This will be an opportunity to try and solve a low stakes problem out of your comfort zone. I hope to get a feel for what you are interested in so we can do better on future projects and puzzles. Feel free to communicate with each other and if you would like assistance or to meet up other times I can organize something. If you all end up enjoying this puzzle we can revisit a future problem, there are new ones released every month. 

These puzzles can be submitted until the last day of the month and you can work on this puzzle throughout that whole time. Looking forward to seeing of what you can come up with :-) 

JS 2025; not liable for any existing bugs in the code.


## Future Options:
- optimize better: GPU / outsourced computer / more efficient algo
- prune inefficient / incorrect options sooner
- analyze the structure of the problem, what does the given numbers tell us about the type of number we will have at the end
